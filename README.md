What is Markdown?
=================

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
It is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else.
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text,
without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

See [official website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for syntax.


What is markdown-oo-php?
========================

It's an object-oriented, PSR compatible PHP library capable of converting markdown text to XHTML.

    $l->register();

    use MaxTsepkov\Markdown\Text;

    echo new Text($markdown);
